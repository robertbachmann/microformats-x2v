DESCRIPTION:In the aftermath of 9-11\, the world became a different place. The word 'Terrorism' is the new buzzword of the Neocon empire-builders\, their corporate consorts and mainstream media moguls.

The real threat\, however\, appears to be the rapid dismantling of the constitutional rights of average citizens to speak out\, express dissent\, information and truth. Well\, have no fear\, because Culture Jamming and 'Hacktivism' have become the tools of the trade for information warriors\, and new technologies are upping the ante..

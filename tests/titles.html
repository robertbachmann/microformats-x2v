<!--
This test is intended to that all variations of input for feed and entry titles
are handled correctly, including the handling of disambiguation rules.

Features tested:
	- If class=title element exists, it is used as the title
	- Otherwise, if h? elements exist the first one is used
	- h? and class=title elements outside of the feed do not interfere
	  with processing

Features not tested:
	- Possible title elements within content and summary fields. These
	  will probably be a problem for the current code if they occur before
	  the actual title element, as no opaque check is applied in code.

Scope of possible change:
	- The output of this test case is not valid atom.
	  Notably, id and updated elements do not exist at the feed level.
	- Changes in the hAtom specification may invalidate this test case
	- Comparisons between actual and controlled test output should not
	  take order into consideration, except where the atom specification
	  indicates order is important.
	- Comparisons between actual and controlled test output should not
	  consider whitespace important, except where the atom specification
	  indicates whitespace is important.

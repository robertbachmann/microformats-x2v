<!--
This test is intended to verify that a document containing all supported hAtom
elements has all such elements correctly translated into atom. It additionally
tests normalize-whitespace requirements by inserting newlines into the source
document that should not appear in the result document.

Tests for specific varitions of individual features should ideally be placed
in their own test files. The intention of this file is to test the overall
structural behaviour of a hAtom file rather than go into the details of how
author or other elements may vary.

Features tested:
	- Whitespace normalisation
	- Feed title element works
	- Feed updated element works
	- Entry title element works
	- Entry published element works
	- Entry updated element works
	- Entry content element works
	- Entry bookmark (permalink) element works
	- Entry summary element works
	- Entry author element works

Features not tested:
	- Feed author elements work (not currently defined by hAtom)
	- Multiple feeds within a single hAtom document
	- Multiple summary and content elements within a single entry are
	  not yet implemented. They should be collapsed into a single content
	  and and a single summary node per entry.
	- A single entry with no rel=bookmark link is not tested. It is supposed
	  to take on the URI of the source document.
	- Multiple published and updated entries in a single entry should be
	  disambiguated by choosing the first one that appears of each.

Scope of possible change:
	- The output of this test case is not valid atom.
	  Notably, id and updated elements do not exist at the feed level.
	- Changes in the hAtom specification may invalidate this test case
	- Comparisons between actual and controlled test output should not
	  take order into consideration, except where the atom specification
	  indicates order is important.
	- Comparisons between actual and controlled test output should not
	  consider whitespace important, except where the atom specification
	  indicates whitespace is important.
